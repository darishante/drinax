# Pirates of Drinax

3D-models (and possibly other stuff?) for the Pirates of Drinax campaign.

The harrier exterior model is (C) Sean McNally <https://sean3d.com> and is used with permission.

All the SketchUp models are created with SketchUp Make 2017, which is the last free version of SketchUp. When updating the models, take care to maintain compatibility with this version.

When editing the interior models, please be careful about polygon counts! At present, the entire model just about holds together, but adding new textures or importing complicated submodels should be avoided. As a rule of thumb, no single object (chairs, posters, whatever) should be more than 500 kb and hopefully a lot less than that. So even if you though your character's stateroom would look completely awesome with a detailed executive desk toy, please try to restrain yourself with the amount of detail.

The same goes with textures: try not to add a huge bunch of new, complicated textures as they bring up the size of the models.

In the <b>Catalogs</b> folder you can find the local systems that have been created in Space Engine. The correct place for this folder is C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steamapps\Common\SpaceEngine\addons
